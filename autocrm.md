AutoCRM: AI-powered Customer Relationship Management
Background
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) applications, like Zendesk, are central to many businesses. They help support and sales teams manage diverse customer interactions while integrating with other essential tools.


CRMs often direct users to FAQs and help articles before allowing them to submit a ticket. However, many issues still require manual support, making CRMs one of the biggest sources of human labor.


AutoCRM leverages generative AI to minimize this workload and enhance the customer experience. By integrating existing help resources with the capabilities of LLMs, AutoCRM delivers an interactive support and sales experience with minimal human involvement. While some tickets may still require manual handling, the threshold is significantly raised, improving operational efficiency and boosting profitability.
Submission Guidelines
At the end of each week, you’ll need to submit the following to the GauntletAI LMS:

AI Objectives (Week 2)
Enhancing Ticket Management with AI
You've built a ticket management system—now it's time to integrate AI to minimize repetitive tasks and elevate efficiency. The goal is to enable a highly automated customer service system, where AI resolves most tickets and significantly reduces the workload on human agents.
Baseline AI Functionality
LLM-Generated Responses
Use a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate responses for customer tickets.
Ensure responses are courteous, user-friendly, and assistive.


Human-Assisted Suggestions
When human action is required, the LLM should:
Suggest or prepopulate a response to speed up resolution.


RAG-Based Knowledge Management
Provide the LLM with relevant context to ensure factual responses.
Use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to retrieve necessary knowledge.
Ensure the RAG system is extensible, allowing administrators to add or update knowledge sources.


Agentic Tool-Using AI
Analyze and route incoming tickets by type, priority, or other criteria.
Design an extensible system enabling the AI to interact with external APIs for better interoperability.


Advanced Features
Refined Self-Service Support
Automate the entire support experience for most cases, with AI managing end-to-end ticket resolution.
Establish clear workflows for escalation and routing to human agents when necessary.


Human-in-the-Loop Enhancements
Create a streamlined queue and user experience for human review.
Ensure seamless integration of human oversight into the AI-driven workflow.


Multi-Channel and Multi-Modality Support
Allow users to request and receive support across multiple channels, including:
Phone
Chat
Email
Incorporate audio and visual elements into support interactions for richer user experiences.


AI-Summarized Ticket and System Status
Provide admins with a dynamically updated dashboard view.
Include AI-generated summaries of system performance and ticket status.
Enable interactive Q&A for admins to query system data.


Learning and Growth System
Log and save outcomes when tickets require human intervention.
Use this dataset to improve the AI’s ability to handle similar cases in the future automatically.


Outcome
The result is a system where AI agents handle a significant portion of the workload, allowing human agents to:
Guide or oversee AI processes.
Focus on resolving complex or edge-case tickets.
By implementing these features, your system transitions from a basic ticket manager to an intelligent, scalable, and efficient customer support platform.
